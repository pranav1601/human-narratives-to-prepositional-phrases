      "['Okay, birth story. So, because we\\'re at even more high risk now with this diagnosis and my age and everything else, we were given regular visits. I had like a standing Friday visit with our OBGYN and at 37 weeks, at that particular visit, he said, \"You\\'re going to have a baby today.\"', 'Despite that fact that we should have been prepared, we weren\\'t. Like I didn\\'t even have a bag packed, crazy as it sounds. So, we-we live about a mile from the hospital, so I was like... He was saying, \"Go to the hospital right now.\" And I\\'m like, \"Well, I have to go home and pack a bag.\" He\\'s going, \"No, you\\'re going to the hospital right now.\"', 'The baby... one of the cords that goes to the baby was squeezed and so they weren\\'t happy with the amount of blood flow and the size of the baby was 20% smaller and there\\'s pressure from the amniotic fluid and, so they were at the point where they said, \"He\\'ll be safer outside the womb than inside, so go right now.\"', 'But, we went home anyway. We didn\\'t listen. XXX I packed a bag and we called all our family members and said, \"It\\'s happening!\" And so we went and checked in and they broke my membrane and they put the IV in, and basically said it\\'s going to take a while, you know, so get relaxed, get comfortable. And my husband and I, I don\\'t know why but, we just got delirious and we were like laughing so much that they... They had all these monitors on me and I was setting off the monitors because we were cracking each other up and just having a good old time in there. And they\\'re coming in and the numbers from my heart rate were all wacky and they\\'re like, \"What\\'s happening?\" \"He\\'s making me laugh.\"', 'We were just excited and so happy. So then my-my family was in Virginia so my mom and my sister had been invited to be in the room. You could have three people in the room at my hospital, so my husband, my mom and my oldest of my sisters. So they drove up, and they were there and they... When they arrived they checked in and said, \"How are you doing?\" And they\\'re like, \"Oh, she\\'s only three centimeters. It\\'s going to be a while. Go have dinner.\" They went-they went in the cafeteria of the hospital and they were gone an hour. When they came back they thought I was holding a pillow, but I\\'d had my baby. And they were so mad. They missed the whole thing.', 'So what started happening was all of a sudden I went super fast. I went like from three to seven centimeters really, really fast and they all start... They were coming in and going, \"Oh! Oh wow! Okay.\" Like... They had, had told the NICU team to be ready because that\\'s where they thought my son would end up with all the things going on. They found more issues, like kidney and bladder and, so they\\'re like, \"He\\'s going to go to the NICU and the NICU team\\'s going to be here ready to whisk him away. Don\\'t be alarmed if he comes out blue or quiet. You won\\'t get to hold him, but he\\'s in the best hands.\"', 'So-so they\\'re like scrambling now. Like, \"Oh my gosh! She\\'s going to go and the NICU teams not here.\" They\\'re running around getting ready. Well, the woman next to me was having a natural delivery and she was screaming her brains out. I\\'m-I\\'m done laughing now. I\\'m looking at my husband going, \"What are they doing to that woman next door?\" Like, \"They\\'re cutting off her limbs or something. Can you peek...? I asked him to peek out the window with a mirror and try to look in that room and see what was going on because I didn\\'t want that to happen to me.', 'So then, I had wanted also to do a natural child birth, but now I\\'m terrified. I\\'m like, \"No. Uh-uh. Go get the guy that\\'s with the needle. I\\'m not going through whatever\\'s happening to that woman.\" So they came in and they\\'re giving me, kind of poked my spine, to-to get the needle in. And they couldn\\'t get it in. And they\\'re saying, \"Are you a weight lifter or something because you\\'ve got the spinal cord outer covering of somebody who lifts a lot of weights. Like We never have this much trouble.\"', 'And they kept poking and poking, and my husband hates needles so he started to pass out. And they had to sit him down in a chair. I was getting so mad. I was like, \"Do not pass out on me now! You\\'ve got to be kidding me!\" He\\'s like, \"I got to take a seat.\" So now all the nurses are turning to take care of him and I\\'m like, \"You\\'ve got to be kidding me.\"', 'The anesthesiologist it turns out... I had a pocketbook from the University of Virginia and so he, he knew... That was his alma mater. So he started singing me the fight song from our college. And so here I\\'ve got one man passing out and another one singing a fight song. I was just like, \"This is not appropriate. This is not what I want right now.\" Because every time they poke you with the needle they have to time it with your contractions and I\\'m in active labor. So they have to wait for the contraction to be over and then when I\\'m done, instead of me getting to rest, they\\'re poking me, poking me, poking me. Oh, here comes another contraction and they had to stop.', 'So this was like dragging on and becoming ridiculous. And I\\'ve got these insane men who are just really adding to the stress of the thing. I was getting so mad at the anesthesiologist. I was just like, \"Please stop. Don\\'t sing anymore.\"', 'And so they laid me down and said, \"It\\'s time to push.\" And the anesthesia, anesthesia didn\\'t take. Supposedly, you shouldn\\'t feel anything from the waist down and you shouldn\\'t be able to really move from the waist down, but I could totally feel on the right side. And I was kicking my leg going, \"Look, look! I\\'m moving! Is this right? I think this is wrong. I don\\'t want to feel. I don\\'t want to be like the woman next door.\" But they didn\\'t have time to-to redo it, so they\\'re like, \"You just got to go with it. Right now. It\\'s go time.\"', 'So they said, \"Push.\" And I pushed so hard that he almost flew out. They were like, \"Stop, stop, stop! No more pushing, no more pushing.\" And then I\\'m going... It felt, there was less pain if I pushed. So I was like, \"You can not tell me not to push right now. I got to push. I got to push.\"', 'So three pushes total. He came out. And they had told me he might be quiet and blue, but he was pink and he was screaming. It was beautiful. It was wonderful. But they, they didn\\'t let me hold him. They took him away and I saw the NICU team just huddle around him and I still got to do the placenta so I\\'m just laying there on the table, trying to peek in between the bodies at what they\\'re doing to him. And finally they parted and they brought Kaden, my son\\'s name is Kaden, they brought him back to me and they said, \"He\\'s fine. Congratulations. Thank you for letting us watch.\" And I was like, \"Sure, yeah. You should have brought some popcorn. No problem.\"', \"And so they, they let me hold him and that was when my mom and sister had walked back in because they had missed all of it. They thought I was playing a trick on them. And so then we called the rest of the family and it was going on like 10 o'clock at night and I have three sisters who are all married with kids and my husband has four siblings, married with kids, so we've got this massive amount of people that want to know how he's doing, because again, he was expected to go to NICU. They were all terrified for us. And he was healthy. He didn't need to go.\", 'So the nurses were really nice. And we had this huge party. Like, I don\\'t know, 25 people jammed into my room all looking at Kaden. I was exhausted and they kept telling me, \"Let the mom sleep, let her sleep.\" And I\\'m like, \"There\\'s no way.\" Like, We\\'ve-we\\'ve been through a lot these last few months and they\\'re all here to support him and it was just so beautiful to have everybody we love right there to see him and his first few moments. It was awesome.', 'And he did end up staying in the hospital for five days because he had jaundice. And as he grew, he did have other conditions that they couldn\\'t tell prenatally, but those first few days of him not needing the NICU, that was just, oh so, so wonderful. And he got out of the hospital on 4th of July and we said, \"Yay, it\\'s his independence day!\" And so we got out and brought him home. So that\\'s the birth story.', 'Comment:\\tReviewed by MG 05/14/2019, again by AG 4/20/20', '']\n",

      "[\"Well Waverley was our, is our 10th child. Yeah. She's baby number 10. When I was about six weeks along with her, I started hemorrhaging a lot and we actually thought we had a miscarriage. We made the two hour, almost two-hour trek up to the emergency room. We live in the middle of nowhere in North Dakota.\", \"Yeah. It's like an hour and 45 minute drive up there. So we got up there and found out I had a, a condition where I had blood clots in the lining of my uterus. It's called subchorionic hematoma, but it got me the proud position of being on bed rest for seven months of the pregnancy. So when it was time to have her, I'd had previous C-sections, so she was a planned C-section. And three weeks before she was scheduled to come, I started going into labor for the first time in my life. My first six children were all induced and then C-sections after that. I'd never gone into labor on my own.\", 'So we went up there, they got labor stopped, and they kept me in for a few days. And then we... they did the C-section that Friday on July 5th. It, it was a pretty normal C-section. With Waverley we never did any, testing. We didn\\'t, because it wasn\\'t going to make a difference to us. We would deal with whatever we were dealt. About six weeks before she was born, I had a feeling, I told my husband she had Down Syndrome. And he laughed and told me I was being paranoid. And I felt with Waverley because of the blood clots and the bedrest, we had to have three non-stress tests every week and ultrasounds. And towards the end about six weeks before she was born, two or three times in a row, different technicians would make the comment, \"Oh look at that. Her little tongue is sticking out.\" And it was like, one time, not a big deal, but three in a row. And then all of a sudden about five weeks before she was born, they noticed her femur measuring differently than what it should have been.', 'So I guess I had a gut feeling. But then when she was...we were in the operating room, the delivery, surgical operating area. My husband was in there. We did the C-section. Any other time when they had, I\\'d had a baby, they always brought the baby immediately over to me and, and let me you know hug, kiss, all of that. They wouldn\\'t bring her over. They, there was a little bassinet and they rolled her up to me and had her feet towards me. And they immediately were going to take her to the NICU. And I\\'d ask why. And they said she was just having a little bit of trouble with her breathing and they felt better doing it. Okay, I said, \"Can I see her? You know before you go, can I, can I see her?\" And they rolled her around just enough so that I could reach out and touch the top of her head. And that was it. And-and-and then they took her away.', 'And of course my husband was really torn. He didn\\'t know whether to stay with me or go with her. And I said, \"Go. Go with her. I\\'m fine. Go with her.\" And then of course, you know all the finishing up of the surgical procedure before I got to the postsurgical unit. And, because in the, the postsurgical unit is where we got our official diagnosis.', 'So when you say stop at the diagnosis portion, do you mean the official or because what happened in that postsurgical unit is a big part of why I try and help get awareness out. Yeah it-it was, it was very scary because I knew, as I said, I-I had the gut feeling that she had Down Syndrome, but to be in there and have things going so differently because again, baby number 10, so I had been down this road numerous times.', \"And it was, it was different because there was a lot of hushed whispering. The fact that they wouldn't let me see her. They wouldn't answer questions. It-it was terrifying. I was very scared. I felt very alone because even though I wanted my husband to go with her, you know I had just lost my only connection and-and lifeline of anybody that I knew. And even though it didn't last really long, it seemed to last so, so slow time. Just wanting to get an answer of how she was, what's going on. So yeah, it was not a very good experience for what it should have been, especially after... You know because the emotions were already so rough because of, the conditions that I had with her and bedrest for seven months, and it-it was, it just, it sucked is the only way to put it.\", 'Comment:\\tReviewed by AG 5/11/20, and again by CG 05/12/20.', '']\n",

      "['So we were... Because we... they knew he had a heart hole, we were not... The options were quite limited as far as what we were basically allowed to do, if you will. So, they...

And so, that Tuesday, we were actually planning to go shopping.', 'My mom my mom came with me because my husband couldn\\'t take the time off, because he knew he was going to be taking time off the following week, and so I asked my mom to come with me. We were going to go to go to Ikea. She doesn\\'t have one in her city. It was going to be like a fun adventure, and then... then, what... I was kind of freaking out, because they said, \"Okay, we\\'re going to do the nonstress test.\" I was really glad to have my mom there with me because if I had\\'ve been alone, I probably would have been losing it, and then I would have been stressed, but... who knows. So, we we did the nonstress test, and he was fine. She said... she came in and she said, \"It looks perfect. He\\'s not under stress, so... So that\\'s fine, but we\\'ve made it this far. We\\'re not taking any chances at this point. So, go home and pack, and we\\'ll see you tomorrow.\" So our...', \"Our birth story got changed, so I I lost that day at Ikea. And I... and I lost my three days. I was like I I wasn't ready. I don't... I don't know if you're ever ready, but I felt like, oh, I wasn't ready. I still had a few more days to get ready, and I lost those, but whatever. So... yeah, so we came back the following morning, scheduled a C-section. We were like first thing kind of thing, so I think we arrived at the hospital at 8:00 a.m., and at that time, we had told- we had been told that how long we would be in the hospital. For me, it would be you know two or three days kind of thing, based on the C-section healing. But with Seamus, it would depend on him. We didn't know if it was a boy or a girl at that point, actually. It was the one thing I wanted, was a... was a surprise. The one thing you can never guess for certain, right. [It's a guess so...] There were a few times that I felt like they might have slipped, but whatever.\", 'So anyway, so he... so we found out it was he. So the story goes 8:00 a.m. we arrived and we got prepped for surgery. We had been told to prepare for like three or four days in... In hospital for me, and then depends on how the baby does. So... so I got like the needles in the back and whatever, and... and I remember... I remember asking, \"What if I have to like... What if my toes are itchy, or I I have to wiggle my toes? Are you going to scratch them for me?\" And they were like, \"Can you feel your toes?\" And I was like, \"Oh, no.\" So then, you know... basically, I was ready. And then... Yeah, so then it was just... My husband was in the room with me, and they had the the barrier up so he couldn\\'t see like the lower half of me basically being cut in half, and... but he was there, and then he had been like sort of prepped.', \"So, I guess they had done like some other sort of prepping of my husband, whatever, what would happen, et cetera, et cetera. And then so... Yeah, so it was... I remember like... things like I... I didn't have any stretch marks. I had an almost stretch mark, and things like afterwards, I had a stretch mark, so I think that was actually where the the doctor had been pressing to pull him out, et cetera. He... She pulled him out and he immediately cried, and I was like... you know just... Obviously, just completely emotional and I started, bawling, because I was like, he was fine, you know? That cry was just like any other baby would cry. It was just like you expect from any normal situation, and and it was like a huge relief kind of thing. But then...\", \"So, then they put him on the scale and and did all kinds of things, and we got to see him and hold him and whatever. And then... Then, I didn't get to see him for... It wasn't that long. I was I was taken to recovery, and he was taken somewhere else. I I think Tony, my husband, was with me. I I don't actually remember [because it's] a bit fuzzy on the details, but I felt like it was a long time. Like It might have been an hour or two. Maybe it was 45 minutes, maybe it was half an hour. It seemed too long, you know? I wanted to do skin-to-skin right away, all this kind of stuff, and that wasn't XXX. But they did let me do skin-to-skin within you know the half hour, two, hour and a half, however long it was, and he tried to latch right away to feed, which was awesome. He wasn't strong enough, which was a whole other drama that we would learn about later.\", \"But you know he was doing all the things that you want a baby to do, and he was awesome and beautiful. It was a boy, which I still... I still feel surprised about, because I had had girl vibes kind of the whole pregnancy, and then, towards the eight-month, nine-month I started to think, maybe it's a girl maybe it's not a girl; maybe it's a boy. So, I was still pretty shocked when they when I found out it was a boy. But but to be honest, given, like you know... given what physiologically, what girls go through compared to boys, I I feel like with down syndrome and everything else, I do feel like it's a bit of a relief. Like I won't necessarily have to worry about him becoming pregnant, or you know things like that.\", \"Yes, and even just things like you know getting his period and stuff like that, like that won't be an issue. And so now, there will be other issues that will be strange and difficult for me to handle, and it might go have to go to my husband, but but regardless, I I felt like, from a physiological perspective, I was kind of relieved that it was a boy with down syndrome as opposed to a girl with down syndrome. I feel like the girls might have it harder. So, then... so I got to hold him, got to try a skin-to-skin, and then, basically, I went to my recovery room and he went to the NICU. And in that time, I guess there were quite a few sort of tests and things that they had done, but I I didn't really know about it. And my family was in the... like came in...\", \"... were able to come in and see me, my my brother and sister and brother-in-law, sister-in-law, my mom and dad. My husband's family lives in DC, so they weren't able to come. We told them not to come until we were home from the hospital, just because we're not going to be around, and... And they may as well see us when they could see us kind of thing. And so, then, I I had to sit around and wait until the freezing came out, so I had to wait until I was allowed to go see Seamus again, until my legs thawed enough that I could get into the wheelchair. And that was really upsetting. Like even now, I know there's some things that impacted my ability to bond with him, and that was one of it, because I couldn't go see him. Like I just wanted... He'd been in me for nine months, and now he was gone, down the hall. Not even down the hall. He was on another floor in the hospital.\", \"And so, that was really hard, and and I mean, I had my family around to distract me, and then I had to start pumping to bring my milk in and to also... like.... We didn't know if he was going to be able to breastfeed. We didn't know. I wanted to breastfeed, and like I was determined that he was going to have breast milk for as long as he could, because I wanted him to have the best chance of an immune system and all of this kind of stuff. But we were told with his VSD that he might not be able to, so I I started pumping every four hours every three hours at that point, and I continued that for nine months, because I'm a masochist. So yeah, so I think it was probably 7:00 p.m. or something when I was actually able to see him again, and and our C-section was scheduled at 10:00. So yeah, so it was like all day. It was really hard.\", \"Yeah, and my family was bringing back pictures to show me of my boy, and he was mine, and they could see him and I I couldn't, and I didn't think that was right. I still don't think that's right. Like they should be able to wheel the beds into the NICU so the moms can see them, you know? So same thing that night. I was like beside myself because I just wanted my baby, and I didn't know, really, like how he was doing, if he was going to do okay. At that point he already had an NG tube in, a nasogastric tube, because he... They needed to make sure they were getting enough nutrition in, and he you know he wasn't he wasn't breastfeeding from me, so he... and I didn't want bottles, and so the option and... you know I just didn't know if he was okay, and I just wanted to hold him. And...\", \"To this day, it's probably now, finally, when he's three years old, that I have overcome, I guess, the... the lack of bonding that I that I missed out on. Like I definitely had postpartum, and it was definitely worse. And it was... It started that moment, when I wasn't able to hold him. And then... Yeah, so it was hard. And then... So then, over the next... This is where the timeline and the details start to get a little bit fuzzy, because it was kind of... It was a lot of stress and it was it was it kind of some frustration as well. So, he was doing fine. He was born on a Friday... a Wednesday, and there were some things that were done, but then there were some other tests that that couldn't be done until the following Monday, and so things like... They wanted to do an MRI. He was... it... I don't know if it was an ultrasound that told them that there was partial partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, so essentially I'm... I'm a psych major and and studied psych... cognitive psychology.\", \"So, I knew brain structures and functions and whatnot. And so, I knew that... Well, for some... in some ways, they don't know what the corpus callosum does, and so having it somewhat not as completely formed, I we were like, well, what does it mean? Well, they don't even know what it does when it's completely formed, so if some of it's not there, is it a big deal? But it was just like... when we... we had always... I had always said that his.. like I was never going to terminate because we were learning about his diagnosis, his his his situation, so that we could be prepared and so that we could help him in the best way that we could. But when we found out that he had a like a brain malformation, then it was like, what kind you know is he going to be okay? Is he going to have any kind of quality of life? Like are we punishing him by having brought him here?\", \"So, so it was tough, and it turns out like it was partial agenesis, it was partially unformed, but they don't really know. 20 years ago they wouldn't have looked at the brain. They would they would... you know... Even myself being born, they don't know if I my corpus callosum is fully formed. Like there's there's these details that are who cares? Is this information necessary? Does it change anything? Maybe not, so why bother, kind of thing. So, it was a rough... it was a rough first few days, and and you know and then there was the whole issue of I was trying to breastfeed and he was not having it. As it turns out, we're pretty sure it was based on reflux, why he was not having it, why he was... It was the only time he ever cried, was when I was trying to breastfeed him. So, that also impacted our bond.\", 'And so, then we were put on a limit. Even before we left the NICU, we were put on a limit that we were only allowed to try for 15 minutes of breastfeeding, and then we need to stop and he needs to get and be tube-fed. So, there were like rules imposed on us all along, and I I started to really resent the rules. So I guess the... after two weeks... so we were two weeks in the NICU. I think two weeks to the day. And in that time, it was like balancing medications, trying to get him to feed on his own, making sure we were comfortable feeding him with the NG tube, and also making sure that we were having a... Pediatrician follow him in in our city, because we were 45, 50 minutes drive to the hospital, but they wanted to be in a town that we could go to if something went wrong because of his heart defect.', \"So, two weeks after being in the NICU, we were home, and then it was just like trying to do all of this on our own. And I was still pumping all the time, so instead of holding him, I was pumping and trying to feed him. And it was a lot. His his birth and the the few weeks, and actually, up until his heart surgery, those few months were... He had his heart surgery four months... Almost five months old, almost five months of age. In between they had... He had to be in between four and six kilos, four and six pounds. I forget. No, it would be kilos. Because they're bigger, et cetera, bigger, stronger, et cetera, so it's safer. And and up until the surgery it was it was really tough.\", \"Yeah, so I had some postpartum things that came from... came from that, but in in general, his.. his.. the actual birth went well, but it was sort of the things that happened afterwards that kind of started this spiral of difficulty, I guess you could say. We actually... After... He started pulling the tube out regularly, and so at one point... Because we were still sort of having this rule imposed on us by the pediatrician and the cardiologist that we you didn't want him using up all of his energy and nutrition to get his nutrition in. That's where the rule came from, was that you didn't want him to work so hard at getting the food that he's not going to gain weight and get strong. That was... that's why the rule existed, that you couldn't he couldn't become overtired by feeding. Like I...\", 'We understood why it was there, so actually, he pulled the tube out and we decided... We talked to our pediatrician and we were like, \"Can we just see how he does without it?\" And that was Mother\\'s Day. He was born in February, and that was Mother\\'s Day weekend, and it was a gong show. He like tried to drink from a bottle all day. All day, basically, he just had no energy, and so at from that point, I probably should have done it earlier on in his life, because up until that point, I resented their rules, I resented their like I have to do this, you have to be doing this, he can\\'t do this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.', 'Once I learned that, I realized that oh, this is really the only reason he\\'s alive, and I I stopped resenting it, basically. Until that point, it was like, this is... you know my my control had... It was nonexistent. But once we you know decided, our pediatrician said, \"Yes, you can always try for a day or two, and you can put the tube back in if it doesn\\'t work out,\" and we put the tube back in and we didn\\'t try again, because at that point, we got it.', 'Comment:\\tReviewed by MF, May 20, 2019, and again by AG 4/20/20.', '']\n",

      "['She was born at 39 weeks so she was pretty much right on schedule. I had a work meeting the night before, that I sat through, and definitely had a lot of contractions the night before. But just figured I was, with both of the girls I was just like, \"Eh, I don\\'t want to go in too early and have to get sent home.\"', 'So I was up all night with contractions and finally I think about 6:00 I woke up my husband and like, \"We should probably, probably go get this checked out.\" It was pretty intense. Our other daughter, she was 2 1/2 so we had to go take her somewhere else. The hospital was about an hour away so we drove up there. And you know, I mean It was my second baby so I thought I knew what I was doing  but clearly we got there and the contractions were two minutes apart and I was only two centimeters dilated. I thought this is going to be an awful, awful delivery.', \"But she was sunny side up, is what they called it. So they wanted her... So I was having back labor really bad. So I definitely would never wish that on anybody because that was really, really awful. But I was in labor like that for 15 hours. Yeah, 15 hours. It got to 12 hours and they finally gave me the epidural. They wouldn't give it to me until she flipped over. But it worked out okay because I delivered with a midwife. I had stated previously that we weren't super thrilled with the perinatologist. With her... She had a lot of negativity and, you know encouraging us to terminate and stuff. So I switched to a midwife office and that's who delivered, which turned out to be a really good experience because like I said, I was in labor forever.\", 'When it was time for her to come, I started pushing and she was like, \"Nope, go ahead and stop.\" So I didn\\'t even push and she was delivered. So I guess, you know the awful labor kind of balanced itself out with not having to push at all. But... Yeah so... We... Knowing with the prenatal diagnosis, we did have a NICU team in the delivery room. I\\'m pretty sure they were all gone before she was completely delivered. She did not have any NICU time or anything. The perinatologist was nowhere around because we asked her not to be. She... We asked her not to-we just... We wanted-we wanted people to understand that our baby was valuable to us and we loved her regardless.', \"I think that was really hard for her to digest. So, She did tell us like that it was really unusual for her to not deliver the baby. But we... Like from diagnosis to birth she followed the baby and I went to the midwife office. So she was still involved in the pregnancy but just not in the birth. For my own mental health, I think at that point we just didn't need, didn't need that negativity. But all in all the birth was a really pretty normal experience. She was healthy. She came home two days later. No complications or NICU time. She was eight pounds, so I mean yeah, a pretty normal delivery.\", 'Well and... Like I said they, they had told us she would have to go to the NICU and I-I questioned it. I\\'m like, \"Well why, why are we sending her there? What\\'s the basis for it.\" They were like, \"Because she has Down Syndrome.\" I\\'m like, \"That alone to me is not enough to send her to the NICU, so you need-I need a better reason if you\\'re going to take my baby to the NICU.\" And There wasn\\'t one. But I think... I don\\'t know, So many people get wrapped up in the doctors know... Half of the doctors don\\'t know what they\\'re saying but they just get so, so stuck in their head that that\\'s what has to be done. And, you know... We learned very early on that you have to question everything the doctors are saying and [depends] XXX sounds right.', \"So She very well could have ended up in the NICU unnecessarily, but we-we fought that before she was even born, that she didn't need to go unless there was complications. And, she was our second kid. So I mean... Our other daughter was only 2 1/2 so I don't know I think it's kind of overwhelming no matter, diagnosis or not, when you have two kids that are two and under. But... I don't know it, it almost felt easier having her. Probably because she was our second so I I kinda knew what I was, felt like I knew what I was doing. It all went pretty seamless and it was, I don't want to say easy because having kids is not easy. I don't know It all just kind of fit right into place. And, I think for us having a prenatal-prenatal diagnosis was what we needed, I think. I think having a birth diagnosis would have probably blindsided us and probably everything wouldn't have gone as smoothly.\", \"But, yeah, we were prepared and like I said we were just ready to welcome our baby then and it wasn't about a diagnosis when she was born then.\", 'Comment:\\tReviewed by MG 06/04/2019, and again by AG 4/30/20.', '']\n",

      "['My daughter\\'s birth story. So we were super excited when we found out we were pregnant with her. It was about six months worth of trying before we got pregnant. And when you\\'re actively trying to have a baby, six months seems like forever. And so it was a pretty typical pregnancy. I was planning on giving birth at a birthing center because I work at a hospital, and I\\'m not a big fan of hospitals, germs, needles, that sort of thing. And so the birthing center is where I really wanted to go and everyone was like, \"You\\'re crazy, you\\'re going to do it without drugs?\" And I was like, \"I would rather do it without drugs at a birthing center than be in a hospital.\"', 'And so at the birthing center, you can give birth there anytime between 37 weeks, which is what they consider early, but full term. And then 41 weeks and six days. And so I remember at work, the week I hit 37 weeks, I was like, \"All right, this baby can come at any time. I am ready.\" And so I hit 37 weeks, like in the middle of the week, I think it was a Wednesday, and all my coworkers were joking. They were like, \"Oh, is the baby coming yet?\" And I was like, \"No, not yet. Like I haven\\'t felt anything.\" And so that was on Wednesday. And then I worked Thursday and Friday, like normal. And Saturday, my husband tells me, \"Oh, like I think I\\'m going to go ahead and just start packing my stuff for the hospital bag because like we should just start getting it ready. I know it\\'s probably going to be a couple more weeks, but it\\'s better to be prepared than not prepared.\" And I was like, \"Okay, like I suppose I could pack my stuff too, but I don\\'t want to pack it today. Like I\\'ll pack it tomorrow after we get home from church and grocery shopping.\"', 'And I really wasn\\'t feeling in the mood to pack either because we had just moved houses, and we\\'d been unpacking the house, and I just was not in the mood to do it. So that was Saturday, and we went to bed that night, and I had been sleeping terrible, so my husband had been sleeping terribly, so he was like, \"I\\'m going to go ahead and take some Benadryl tonight to help me sleep because you\\'re tossing and turning a lot, and you\\'re getting up and down all night to go to the bathroom and because you can\\'t sleep, and you\\'re making me crazy. And I\\'m so tired, I\\'m just going to take some Benadryl.\" It was like, \"Okay, whatever. That\\'s fine. Like take some Benadryl. At least one of us will sleep good.\" We went to bed. And we were going to bed pretty early at that time because we were both just always so exhausted.', 'And that was probably about 8:00, and at 10:00, I had been sleeping, and I woke up and I was like, \"Oh my gosh. That is so weird. I feel like I just peed myself.\" So I like got up and I went to the bathroom, and I was like, \"No. Like I definitely did not pee, like and it\\'s still kind of trickling out.\" And I was like, \"I think my water just broke.\" I was kind of in denial, because I was like, \"It\\'s... I\\'m like only 37 weeks and three days.\" Like the midwife said, \"For sure on your first, plan on going over.\"', 'So like went over and I woke my husband up, and I was like, \"Hey, hey, I think my water just broke, but I\\'m not really sure, so I can\\'t sleep now so I\\'m just going to go upstairs and watch Netflix.\" And he goes, \"Okay, that\\'s fine.\" I said, \"Maybe you should put the car seat in the car just in case.\" Because I hadn\\'t installed the car seat. Like we didn\\'t need the car seat yet. I was only 37 weeks along. So he like goes, and he throws the car seat in the car.', 'And I came upstairs and I turned on Netflix, and I was watching... There was like a whole bunch of Disney movies on, so I was like watching Hercules, and Mulan and stuff that I\\'ve seen 10,000 times. And slowly I started having like what felt like period cramps, and I was like, \"Okay, well I think the water is broken, this must be what a contraction is.\" And so I just kind of like laid there and dozed off and on for a couple hours.', 'And finally at like 4:00, I went downstairs and woke my husband up, and was like, \"Okay, well these went from feeling like really bad period cramps to like, okay, this is definitely a contraction. I\\'ve never had one before. But if I had to guess what a contraction felt like, this is what it would feel like.\" I said, \"I don\\'t want to call the midwives yet because it\\'s still so early on, and they\\'re still about five minutes apart. Like I just, I don\\'t know if this is actually it.\" He\\'s like, \"Okay, well we\\'ll call at 5:00.\"', 'So I waited an hour and at 5:00 we called, and they were like, \"How far apart are they?\" And, \"Oh, they\\'re about five minutes apart.\" They said, \"Okay, well come in at 7:00.\" So by 7:00, they were really bad. I thought they were the worst that they were going to get. Little did I know, they get a lot worse. So we were leaving our house to drive up to the hospital because our house is about 25 minutes from the birthing center. And there was a police officer that was driving the opposite way, and my husband was kind of driving fast, and I saw him flick his lights on at us, but he didn\\'t stop and pull us over or anything.', 'So we got all the way up to the birthing center, and they took me into the room, and checked me to see like if it was actually my water had broken, if it was amniotic fluid, and then to check to see how far I was dilated. And they were like, \"Do you want to know like if you\\'re early labor, or active labor, or if it\\'s like full-blown, like the baby\\'s coming? And I was like, just- Or do you want to know how far dilated you are?\" And I was like, \"Just tell me am I early, active, or is the baby coming?\" And they said, \"Oh, you\\'re only early.\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh, like this is terrible, like worst experience ever. How can this only be early labor? Like it\\'s only going to get worse?\"', \"And so then they moved us to the birthing suite so that they could get out the Doppler to check the baby's heart rate. And we didn't know at the time what we were having. And so they were checking the baby's heart rate in between contractions and during contractions. And every time I had a contraction, the baby's heart rate was decelerating. And it always recovered after the contraction ended. But because of these decelerations, about two hours after getting there. So a little bit after 9:00, they decided that they were going to go ahead and transfer me to the hospital, because they couldn't... They didn't have like continuous monitoring, and they wanted me to have a continuous monitoring on, since the baby was having heart decelerations, just to make sure that there was nothing going on with that.\", 'So they called the ambulance and I got into the ambulance at like 9:25, and we got to the hospital at like 9:30. And we got to the hospital, and it\\'s the hospital that I work at. So anytime you go into a patient\\'s chart that works there, you have to do this thing called breaking the glass, so that you\\'re not just going into patients\\' charts to read them. And all I can remember asking is like... Them asking is like, \"It wants me to break the glass. Do you work here? Do you work here?\" I was like, \"Yes, I work here. I don\\'t care. Break the glass. For the love of God, please like just get into my chart.\" And they were like, \"Okay.\"', 'And they like got me into the room and started getting me settled, and the anesthesiology guys came in, and were like, \"Okay, like do you want some nitrous?\" And I was like, \"Sure, that would be great. Anything to take the edge off now because like this is the worst thing ever. I don\\'t know what I was thinking, thinking I could do this without drugs.\" And so they like... they\\'re like, they\\'re like \"Do we have your consent?\" Like and they gave me the whole spiel about warnings and stuff like that. And I was like, \"I don\\'t care, just get me something.\" And they like were giving me the IV, and like they wheel in the big tank of nitrous. And clearly like it must\\'ve been a man that invented it because it had a wrench at the top, and they had to like use the wrench to try to unscrew it, to loosen it up so the nitrous would flow.', 'And they were working on trying to get that done. And I was like, \"Oh my gosh, like I feel like I need to push.\" And they were like, \"No, no, no, don\\'t push. Like the midwife told us like you\\'re still early.\" And I was like, \"No. If I have been sure of anything in my life, it\\'s that I need to push now.\" And they checked me, and they\\'re like, \"Oh my gosh, like the baby is coming.\" And like my husband said that they hadn\\'t even like opened up any of like the tools or anything like that, so the nurses are like ripping open things, and like trying to lay stuff down on the bed. And I pushed like three times and out popped our baby, and it was probably the most eventful, like 30 minutes of the whole birthing experience. Just getting transferred and getting into the hospital, and them asking all these questions, and for consent, and this, then that, and then all of that stuff for like the baby to come within like 30 minutes of getting there.

      "[\"Well, Lucas' birth story, let's see. Where do I begin?\", \"Well, I was going to the to the hospital, I think after, at 35 weeks or so I was going to the hospital twice a week. My doctor started me getting ultrasounds twice a week because they were checking his growth because he was very little so they wanted to make sure that he was growing and you know, his weight because he would not like, you know, he wasn't he wasn't really wasn't growing that fast, gaining weight. He was so little. So I would go every every, you know, every two times a week and they would check. It was growing slowly. And then on a Saturday, I was 39 weeks, I think then I was 39 weeks. And it was a Saturday, so I went in for, you know, one of my regular checkups and you know, they did the ultrasound, they check everything.\", 'You know, okay, we go to the waiting room and while we wait for the results and stuff like that. And then the midwife, she was midwife was part of my doctor\\'s practice. She comes in, I guess she hadn\\'t been there. So she comes in, and she\\'s like, \"So, you know, the results, you know, it shows, you know, that I guess there\\'s not much , I guess, feedback or, you know, something going on between, you know, getting nutrients in the umbilical, you know, on him or something like that. So we\\'re just going to keep you already. You know, you\\'re already 39 weeks, so we\\'re okay. So we\\'re going to keep you and then just...', \"Okay, then! I was there with my mom, so I was good. My mom had already came to stay with me to, you know, help me out that last month. So I'm like, okay. So I called Julio, who's at work, so I'm like, so they're going to induce for the, you know, they're going to keep me already and...\", 'And okay, I\\'m like, you know, my bag was all ready, you know, here at home and I go home you know, get everything. He\\'s like, \"Okay I\\'ll be there soon.\" You know, he calls me from the house, and he\\'s like, \"You need anything else?\" And I\\'m like, \"No, no, no. Make sure you bring some clothes too.\" And he\\'s like, \"Oh yeah, okay.\"', \"We go.. You know, he gets to the hospital, I'm in another room. And then, you know, because I was not ready obviously for, for that and for giving birth. They're like, they say that they're going to put something, you know, because, you know, , you know, my cervix because it was still hard and very up, so they needed it obviously to drop before they put the the Pitocin I guess, to start the contractions and everything, you know.\", 'And I go, okay.. So they put that and they put the things, you know, to start to be monitoring the babies, you know, contractions and everything. And they\\'re there, you know, for I think about like 45 minutes, you know, they\\'re checking this and then, then my doctor comes in, my actual doctor. And like, okay so, like, during, you know, you\\'re not feeling any contractions, but obviously because of what was, you know, put in your cervix it\\'s like there are very minor contractions. It\\'s like every time there\\'s a little contraction, the baby\\'s heart rate drops. So she\\'s like, \"I can give you the Pitocin so you can start going into labor or, but, like, but, the contractions are only going to get harder and I\\'m not going to, you know, I don\\'t want to put him through that kind of stress. Like, and we\\'re going to end up with an emergency C.', \"So she's like, I'm just going to prepare you for a C section and a prep for a C section is what we are going to do. So whatever you think is best. I think I, you know, she leaves and I freaked out for a little because I was like, Oh no, you know, not a C-section I wanted to have this naturally, this is going to be horrible, this is going to hurt. Oh no, you know, I freaked out a little bit.\", \"So they come, you know, they prep me, they, you know, change, put all the things. They give Julio his package so he could get ready. And, you know, I say bye to my mom now. They kick her out, they're like, okay, we're going to, you know, in a little bit, take her to the, you know, delivery room. Once she's prepped in there, we'll bring, you know, you in there, tell Julio.\", 'So they take me in, you know, and it\\'s so cold in there it was so cold I remember, like, you know, as soon as they rolled me in I\\'m like, \"Oh my God, I\\'m going to freeze in here.\" And I was still, like, nervous. So they kind of put me in the lead, the anesthesiologist comes in and she, you know, she explained to me, you know, they\\'re going to do, you know, the spinal tap. I mean I\\'m from my waist down and, you know, so that\\'s.. She\\'s explaining to me like, okay, okay. She\\'s like, \"Any questions?\" I\\'m like, \"how long have you been doing this?\"', \"That's all I could think of. I was so scared of you know, you eat [you're messy] and like fine!\", '\"And how long have you been doing this?\"', 'She\\'s like, \"20 years.\"', 'I\\'m like, \"Okay.\" I was like okay. I was just waiting you know, like you hear your horror stories, you know, that you have a student that\\'s doing this two years and they\\'re like, no, it\\'s not going to happen to me. So I had to ask that. So it\\'s like, okay, we\\'re going to hold you down. And as soon as I say lean back, , you know, after I do this, you just throw yourself back up.', 'I was like, \"Okay.\" They lean me forward, she\\'s like you\\'re going to feel a little pinch on that. And then next thing you know she\\'s like okay lean back. And I just XXX . I literally couldn\\'t feel anything instantly for like.. I didn\\'t know what anything was. And, you know, they lean me back and they start putting, you know, obviously the IV\\'s or whatever.', 'And they\\'re like, \"how are you doing?\"', 'I\\'m like, \"I\\'m good, I\\'m good,\" and, you know.', '\"And you need anything?\"', 'And I\\'m like, \"A blanket, I need more blankets, it was so cold. And I\\'m like so cold. So they you know put more blankets and kind of, you know, I\\'m a little nervous when I hear I\\'m like, okay, I feel fine. And then my doctor comes in and she\\'s like, \"How are you?\"', 'I\\'m like, \"Good, I\\'m good.\"', '\"Okay, we\\'re going to start.\"', '\"Okay.\" You know, so they put up the, you know, blanket I guess or the little curtain as you call it. And then, and then Julio comes in and, you know, he\\'s like, \"Hi, you know, how are you?\"', 'I\\'m like, \"I\\'m good.\" And then the next thing you know, he\\'s like looking at me, weirdly. I know I\\'m feeling like pressure and kind of, you know... Little things, kind of, you know, movement going on down there, you know, but no pain.', 'But I\\'m just, and he\\'s like, \"how are you?\"', 'I\\'m like, \"I\\'m fine.\"', 'He\\'s like, \"You sure you\\'re okay?\"', '\"Yeah, yeah, I\\'m okay.\" Like okay, and he every time he would look at me and I see he\\'s getting a little, you know, like pale or something..', '\"Are you okay?\"', 'He\\'s like, \"Yeah, are you okay?\"', '\"Yeah, I\\'m okay.\" And then the doctor, next thing you know she\\'s like, \"Okay, you know, he\\'s coming, he tells me, okay get your camera ready. And he\\'s like, okay. He\\'s like flopping around trying to get under his garment and, you know, he gets his phone. And then I felt like, pressure. And then next thing you know, we just.. \"Waah!\" You know, hear the baby cry. It wasn\\'t a harsh cry. It was, you know, just, wah wah, you know, just freely, just not loud or anything, but you know, but I, you know, he cried and then he XXX is going away. He\\'s like, \"You okay? You okay?\"', 'Like, \"Yes. Yes I\\'m fine.\" And then, you know, then they\\'d take the baby I guess to the side. And I\\'m like, \"Go, go,\" because I had told them, \"You stay with the baby, no matter what you stay with the baby.\"', 'And, you know, I hear him crying, and then he kind of stops crying and then then a little bit.. They bring him to me and like, \"You want him?\" I\\'m like, \"Yes, of course.\" So I had told Julio that I wanted to do, you know, because like today,, you know, obviously [I haven\\'t] XXX like I want to you know have him skin to skin. So, they kind of take off, like his little blankie, and put him you know under me, you know, skin to skin. He\\'s just, he\\'s just so. I didn\\'t know obviously how, what to, what my baby was going to look like, you know? You read a lot that all, you know, babies with Down Syndrome have those same characteristics and things like that. And I just saw him and I\\'m like, \"He looks like me,\" you know. Me, this baby is me. And it was just, it was beautiful, he was beautiful and he was just perfect with all this hair and, just I don\\'t know, he was so warm and so.. I couldn\\'t obviously hug them or anything, but they just kind of put him here and I just, you know, so you\\'re just looking at him and I just couldn\\'t believe it.', 'And to me now this is perfect, just perfect that and then he just goes, he tries to go and try to, to get to my boob and just kind of started moving and the nurse is like, \"I think he\\'s hungry. You want to see if he can he can feed?\"', 'I\\'m like, \"Yeah, okay, sure.\"', 'So they kind of move him around and he tries to latch on, and he kind of does and all of a sudden I\\'m like, I felt a little queasy and lightheaded and, you know, and I\\'m like, \"Julio, get the baby I don\\'t feel so good.\" And then I, I just felt like all of a sudden, felt like things were just getting like back, like and I, I heard the doctor say, you know, something, give her something she\\'s feeding too much or something like that. And they gave me something and then I I felt, you know, like, before I say, I was like, I\\'m going out right here, but then, you know, whatever.', \"So then she asks that, you know, that she's going to it's going to take a little longer so they're going to take the baby. And I'm like, okay, you stay with the baby and you know, know the drill. I had instructed him you know that no matter what he stays with the baby, he makes sure that they don't give him any any, you know, formula. And no matter how hungry he is, I had done my research, the baby can wait up to four hours or he's not going to start to death. You did not let him do anything like that. So, they take him, they leave, they work on me a little while longer and then, you know, once that's done they you know take me back to the, you know, I guess, you know where..not intensive care, but the waiting room, you know, where you wait it out, the baby's already there.\", 'So, he\\'s just waiting there for me. And they had brought my mom in and because they could allow two people in. So it was Julio and my mom, and I\\'m, you know, just like joking around and it\\'s just so unbelievable, so amazing. The nurse comes and she\\'s going to get him, you know, give him a little bath and she\\'s, you know she grabs him and obviously this is a pro that knows what she\\'s doing, but this whole time I\\'m thinking, \"Man, they\\'re rough\" because you know he\\'s like, \"Hi,\" you know, they\\'re putting water on him. They\\'re just getting these big, you know, splashy, like, towels and kind of wiping them down with like little water. And I\\'m like oh my goodness, they\\'re so rough. But he liked it because he actually stopped crying. And then when they went to wash his hair and like, oh my God, he has so much hair.', \"And then they're running him through the water. And he really liked it. And I saw videos later of, you know, Julio took videos of that he was just like, you know, and when you go to get your hair done and then massage, you know, your face after, you know when they're washing your hair. And he was just like that.\", 'And then they put him, you know, they put him back, you know, next to me and they\\'re monitoring, monitoring him and stuff. And I think like an hour or two hours later, they\\'re like, \"Okay, we\\'re going to, he\\'s fine.\" You know, I was okay. You know, they were obviously checking everything I was fine. So when they take us to to my room, to what\\'s going to be now my room and they take you know take me, you know, and the baby where we\\'re going there together. I actually, I think I held him while going over there.', 'So now that we\\'re you know here, you know, in the room, they\\'re like, okay, you want to try you know feeding him? I\\'m like, \"Yeah!\" And you know she comes, she tells me how it\\'s done, you know, we tried to get him to latch on and he actually did, he did pretty good. He latched on but, , you know, muscle tone, no muscle tone for, you know, since he had low muscle tone, which really wasn\\'t very significant actually. You know, he wasn\\'t getting as much. He was getting some, but it was just like, it\\'s more than enough for him, trust me. But I was just leaking everywhere. So she gets a panic alarm, \"Give me a hand!\" She\\'s getting a pump and pumping my other breast because I\\'m just thinking, she\\'s like, you know, we don\\'t want to waste it. And she\\'s like you know and you\\'re lucky, because a lot of times when you have C-section, your milk won\\'t come for a day or two.', 'She\\'s like, so on this, just take advantage of this. I can get everything. And I\\'m like, okay. It was, it was day two. It was like around like 9:00, 10:00 by this time. No, later. And like, yeah like 10:00.. he was born at 7:45 so that\\'s late, so you know, he falls asleep and they\\'re checking me, you know, and they tell me, you know, I have to go pee or try to pee on my own and get up and walk and stuff. And I\\'m like, \"Really? You want me to get up and walk?\"', \"I'm like, no. I'm like, I'm in heavy medication here because of the pain and stuff like that. Then the next, then oh, actually Doctor XXX comes in, and they take the baby sadly, and he goes to check them, comes back. Heart is perfectly fine. So that was that. Then I I wanted to carry him, but the nurse said, , you know, just wait a little bit, let him sleep, just keep you know, if he wakes up, you know, call me. So, my mom leaves and Julio stays there with me and this horrible linoleum chair. I think he's had back problem since then.\", \"And I didn't sleep the whole night, pretty much. I I just kind of was just like looking over at the baby and just in awe, counting my blessings. You know, that he was healthy because he was just healthy. You know, he didn't have to go into the ICU. No, no sudden emergency operations no anything. And so I just, I just couldn't sleep. I mean, I was drowsy but I just couldn't really sleep and he would wake up. I would kind of like, you know, try to move over to get him. Then I would call a nurse. She would change him for me she was counting because they had to, they had to count how many times he would go pee because obviously that's how good he was feeding. I would try to feed him. Sometimes he would latch on, otherwise I would give him this like, tiny little nipple bottle that was like that big that they had given me to, you know, pump into.\", \"And he would kind of eat that. So how many ounces did he eat? Like maybe two, okay is that enough? And that was how that whole first night went. The next day, the pediatrician we had, we had chose came to see him. We actually like interviewed like five different more doctors, you know, and we went with this doctor, he can see him, he's like, you know, it's like, yeah, you know but like it's actually really good as far as muscle tone. Like it's not very bad. You know, he would put him upside down XXX because he was so tiny with his five pounds, six ounces. So he would just put him in his one hand and check him you know, he'd kind of like tickle his back or something. And you know, he was squirming. He's like, yeah, he's like, he's worried though. So, so that was once again another just blessing, you know, just to hear that.\", \"Then they, they took him to do the hearing test and he failed the hearing tests and, you know, they come back and, you know, like, sometimes, you know, because we know C-section is not the same ones that are born you know, naturally because you know, their ears sometimes they still have water in them and things like that. So you know, don't think anything of it just yet. Once he's, you know, later on we'll do a different, you know, we'll do it again. Okay. You know, we're fine. And, and then, like, they, came in. They allowed me to kind of help shower him, you know, so. Oh well not shower him, but you know, clean him up again, XXX teach me how to do it, you know, keep his head back, you know, make sure you get all his hair behind the ears because you don't want more water going in the ears and things like that.\", \"He had so much hair, so much hair and then, you know, instead of leaving him in that one ugly blanket, you know, hospital blanket I had, I had all these cute little out and, you know, XXX so my mom had brought for him a bunch of little stuff, cute stuff and a lot of movies and stuff and, and he just looks so cute and you know, you know, or taking pictures and then the, there's like, you know, like a hospital photographer comes and after she, you know,.. to take pictures of him for his XXX by and of course, you know, we did that, you got all these pictures of him for them and they'll have different outfits and, you know, it it just kind of went like that. Nothing bad, and have you know Julio's family came to see us at that next day? His mom and his family, sister and brother or just sister sorry, not his brother.\", \"And you know, there his mom is so, I don't know what's the right word. She was like, well he looks normal and, god, I had to bite down my tongue and you know, it's like you don't say those kind of things, you just don't. And, Julio, you know, he didn't say anything to her then, but I, you know, but later, you know, I know that he did and then, because she apologized. So he didn't say anything to her, [kind of] like but she [had me, which] apologized and she's like, I didn't, you know, I mean anything, you know like that and just, and I just, I get it, you know, and the third day now, because I was there three days, you know, they there, they tell me, you know, we we get to go home. So we, you know, I dressed them up in yellow with the yellow blanket that one of the, a teacher from the school that I, that I worked at, fashion designer, he had made for me this beautiful, he had crocheted, this beautiful yellow and green blanket for him.\", 'And so I dressed them up in yellow. You know, what would you call it, you know, Nicaraguan, you know, superstitious or whatever. And my mom and, but it\\'s just because it\\'s cute too, you know, [they say, you know, when you leave] the hospital, whatever, you know to dress your thing in yellow for good luck and sunshine I like dressing up in yellow, and Julio goes and gets the car they\\'re like, okay, we\\'re going to, you know, we get, we don\\'t get ready. That\\'s smart. I mean, you know, I get dressed, and they, you know, they take me on and the wheelchair, downstairs, offsite, and then Julio posts up in the car and the guy in the wheelchair was like you did not, you realize you don\\'t have the car seat on, guy. And I was like, \"What? He didn\\'t install the car seat? He\\'s like, \"Oh no, I didn\\'t know. I didn\\'t know.\"', \"I'm like, you can't take the baby, you know, without, you know, the car seat is just dangling back there. What do you do? Oh, so the guy helps him solve the crises like this. Then he's like listen, you're not the first and you're not going to be the last it happens all the time. So the guy helped them, I think he was total pro at it. Like, I've done this a million times. And so he helped him, you know, put the car seat. I said that, you know, I'd sit in the back with him, you know, and then we brought him home and, you know, I had his whole room ready, but he didn't stay in his room at all. He, I had a little bath and next to my bed and that's where, you know, he stayed. And then, and, and for the first couple of nights he he would would wake up a little bit.\", 'He wouldn\\'t, he was never a crier. He would just kind of like wake up, move around in the bassinet, like the bassinet were like woo. And then finally, if that did not wake me up or whatever he\\'d go, \"wah\", just little cry and I would wake up, grab him, you know, breastfeed him, you know, kind of brought him back and then let them back to sleep. And then sometimes I would just grab him, breastfeed him, laying kind of down, and then grab him once he would fall asleep and then put him back in his bassinet and he was just so good. You know, you can do such a good baby. He he was not like, you know, you hear horror stories of babies that they don\\'t let you sleep and you\\'re like horrible and it\\'s just like, no, no, he was so good. And then Mother\\'s Day came because he was born October.', \"I mean, April 25th, Mother's Day that year landed early I think like the 10th or something of May. And actually no, before that, like the week before Mother's Day, you know, my sisters were talking on the phone. My mom's like, I'm going to go shopping today. I'm like, okay Mom thanks. And she leaves and then she comes back with my two sisters. You know, they truly XXX [to see the baby] that was awesome. That was so awesome. They were so happy to see the baby and you know, they wouldn't even let me carry him. And then they stayed here through, you know, Mother's Day, which was my first Mother's Day and that was just beautiful and wonderful. So it was so like full of love and you know, he was just loved so much, you know, by everybody, by all of us. And another great thing, you know, that happened, the ladies from the Down Syndrome Association in Miami came to visit him, you know, they'd brought him a big basket and, and you know, they were here for a while.\", \"I had, you know, other friends came to see him just, you know, and everybody was just, you know, god, he's so beautiful. And you know, it's just so much love for all of us. For him. This is birthless. His first was really, really beautiful, you know, I can't, I can't remember anything, really negative about it, you know, we were just so blessed because he was so healthy. That was the most important thing to us. That was just what, you know, everything was secondary, just as long as he was healthy and he was, you know, and so that just made everything great. Anything else we'll just deal with as it comes that and, but his, you know, his birth was awesome, was really awesome. I can't, like I said, I can't remember anything negative about it. You know having him home, you know, the hospital, everything, the nurses were awesome at the hospital, so awesome.\", \"They, the care that they gave us, him and I was just beyond what they even, you know, I you know like if I needed them, you know, to come and help me and teach me this again.. Even though, they had already told me, you know, how to do it. Like never, you know, never bad face even, you know, I at 4:00 in the morning or anything. And then here at home it was just great, aside from the fact that for the first week I really couldn't walk out alone. You know, I was just like, ah. And so I would just be like, you know, carrying him from the bed, you know, from his thing to my bed and it was just great, you know? It was awesome having him here at home. It's, I never, I never expected how great it would be and how, you know, how much everything changes.\", \"You know, once you had that baby here at home, even, you know, the little things either put the TV it's too loud and it's like, it's like only at 10 or something.

      "[\"The morning that I went into labor I was... I called out as sick to work because I just woke up feeling sick. I didn't think that I was in labor but I just didn't feel well, like I just didn't have the energy to go into work so I called in and just said I wasn't feeling well and I might come in later if I was feeling better. But that never happened. So I I stayed home, I had breakfast and I got into the rocking chair with a blanket. I just needed to feel like I needed to curl up and then I started looking through the baby name book. Okay, I gotta make sure in case anything is happening, we we really are sure with our name. And I I felt some cramping, [and I was] a little discomfort but I still just thought maybe it was Braxton Hicks or something. It was eight days from my due date so I was within that timeframe that it could have been labor but I wasn't 100% sure yet. But as the morning went on and I realized that the cramping was getting worse, and coming and going, I started timing it and realizing that they were contractions.\", \"And then I called my husband and he came home at his lunch time, for lunch break, he came home and checked on me and let me know that ... We were expecting it to be a long time. It was our first child and you hear all these stories about being in labor for 24, 48 hours. [You know] we thought that it was going to be a long time so he went back to work but he told me he was going to be in another building for a meeting. And then I went and got into the into the bathtub. I thought being in the water would help relax me but it actually got more intense. So I called my husband right as he was getting into the meeting. He's like that's probably my wife. And I told him I think he needed to come home because the contractions were getting closer. So he came home and and he wanted me to you know get the bag ready and let's get in the car and go and I just didn't feel like doing anything. I was like, no, I think you need to call an ambulance, I can't sit through the trip to the hospital, I'm just so uncomfortable.\", \"So we we finally got to the hospital and got checked in and everything was really quiet. And no kind of emergency or anything. They just checked us in at the front desk and they wanted me to go change into the robe and and check me and get vitals and all of that. So once I finally did all that, then it was like chaos just happened. I I, I got into the gown, I got into the bed, they put all the the IV started or the the everything that they were monitoring. Then they checked me and the nurse, she got really intense and she was like, she's complete and we've got a bulging sack of water. And we need to get the midwife over here now. And then, just like within like a couple of minutes, the midwife was there and they were telling me that I could push. And I remember looking at my husband telling him well I guess it's too late to have anything now, because I wasn't sure whether I was going to have an epidural or not. I just had no idea, being the first. Or if I was going to be able to go natural or not. So when it came to that point, I was like, no I guess it's too late. They're telling me to push. She was born 45 minutes after we arrived at the hospital.\", \"So it it was really close and it was ... I started that morning when I got up and then she was born at 3:45. So it was a pretty quick delivery. I think i would ... The emotions were, I think, more shocked that it had happened so quickly. I just guess I thought we would have a little bit more time to prepare once we got to the hospital. When we did get out of the car and went to check in, I told my husband to leave all of the bags in the car. I was like, don't worry about getting all that, just let me get checked in, once I'm in my room you can come back in and or get all that. That didn't happen because it happened so quickly. So our camera was in the bag, so that is like one of the things I regret, is that there's no camera right there to take all those after, immediately after birth pictures and having her in my arms and all that. We didn't have any of that because the camera was still in the bag. We didn't have anyone you know that was meeting us at the hospital to do any of that.\", \"My husband was in the military, he was in the Air Force so we weren't stationed near any family. His parents were in ... We were in New Mexico and his parents were in Oklahoma, my mom was in Maryland, my dad was in Florida. So when we left for the hospital, at home my husband did call and let everybody know, hey, we're heading to the hospital. And so they did arrive that evening. My mom and my aunt and my sister were able to get a standby flight. They arrived and his parents drove in from Oklahoma but it was, I don't know, eight, ten, PM by the time everybody got there. So there is that little bit of, you know there was that regret that, I told him to leave everything so there was no camera to capture all those moments but mostly I think I just felt shocked that it happened so quickly and that I was expecting it to be a long labor or to be in the hospital for hours and hours before anything happened and XXX 45 minutes later she was born.\", 'Comment:\\tReviewed by AG, 6/18/19, and again by CG 05/02/20.', '']\n",

      "[\"So like I said, I was advanced maternal age, which is so terrifying to hear when you're 36. But, I'm like I really don't feel that fucking old. But, okay thanks. And so, I guess by the time I I was 37 and then my birthday had happened and so, I want to say around October is when, so she was born in December. Her due date was January. So October, like the start of my third trimester is when they started monitoring like hardcore, like not just like every couple of weeks going in, like you're going in every single week. And then by mid November, before Thanksgiving rolled around, I was going in twice a week for monitoring, for those non-stress tests and I say that in quotes because it's fucking stressful.\", \"It's so annoying. Because I've got to drive to the hospital, which is where my clinic was. I got to find a parking space, I got to get upstairs and then they're like, okay, calm down, do you need some crackers?\", \"I need for this non-stress test is for you to come to me and then I'll be non-stressful. But anyway, so I was doing those twice a week. And then it was about, after Thanksgiving, that my doctor told me that, I'm going to I need to start bringing a bag with me because we didn't know what was going to happen and how she was growing. So to back up a little bit. We had, we took those classes at the hospital that they offered, the whole like birthing class, and I made this beautiful birth-thing like this vision of her birth, what we wanted and we wanted it to be you know a natural vaginal birth, and you know baby in room and all this stuff.\", \"And that had started before the intense November stuff started. And so by the time we got to like, Mid November Thanksgiving, that's when we found out that she was slowing down her growth and we were monitoring her heart, because her heart was starting to be a little irregular but they could not see any holes. But like the, the blood she was getting wasn't the blood she was pumping.\", \"Something was weird going on with like, my, the umbilical cord situation. And then, so, we talked to the doctor, both of us, Zach and I and we were just like, so what's going on? What's going to be the best situation here? And I asked, you know, bluntly, I wanted to have, you know, the typical birth, but is that not what's best for her? And she said, because of how small she is and what we're noticing the best thing for her is going to be a C-section. I said, well then let's just do that because I wanted it to be better and easier for for Daisy. That's her name. I hope that's okay. I'm allowed to say names.\", \"But that's... So that's what was best for Daisy. I was like okay 100%, that's what we're going to do. And so it's like everything we just did in those classes just went out the window. At least I know, at least I don't have to poop myself. You know, I had that. So...\", \"So yeah. So we picked a birthday, and you know hoping that we would make it to that birthday and that was exactly at 36 weeks and that that was going to be 12/12 cause my birthday is 08/08 and Zach's birthday is 07/12 so I was like so we have some you know fun, fun with our number's there.\", \"So, so we got to pick a birthday and we're really hoping that we would make it, and we did. And so we checked in and it was so scary, so surreal. You're like out of your body because you know, you're having a C-section, you don't know what to expect and you know something's wrong with your baby. So, but you don't know everything, you know? So it was just like this whole out-of-body experience. And the weirdest thing was, like, they took me back to the operating room, Zach came back, he's all decked out, you know with the gown and all that stuff.\", \"And, the lady tried to put that spinal tap part in four times, it took them four times. Yeah, and I had to bend over the, the pillow and I'm like, how is this not working? And by then, I was just like completely numb like to them doing everything. But they finally got it, it was fine. There was nothing complicated with our birth. It just went the way I guess all the C-sections go and she was born. And what they noticed was that her, my placenta was really small. So I very had like an inhospitable situation going on, inhospitable unit, I call myself. And then the umbilical cord was really small. It's pretty short too. So that's probably what was leading to this like gross, you know XXX her. And then the whole hydronephrosis of her kidney, which was just too much in her kidney. It actually resolved itself within the day.\", \"And then, we got to see her and then she immediately was taken up to NICU. They, you know dealt with me. I go to my room, I sleep forever, I wake up and they take me to the NICU. I get to go see her in the NICU. And, and she was just so small. She was three pounds, 15 ounces, so small, she was a tiny, tiny bean. And, and she ended up being in the NICU for 85 days and they switched hospitals. She was, at the, you know, the local hospital where I gave, you know, gave birth and all that. And they just couldn't figure out what was wrong and what ended up being wrong because she wasn't drinking enough, she couldn't eat. And what ended up being wrong is that she had three small holes in her heart and she had Laryngomalacia, which is a floppy airway. And so she couldn't suck and swallow.\", \"And so that's why she wasn't eating well. She would aspirate, well, she would eat because of the holes in her heart and the blood function and like everything going into her arms. So they moved her to a different hospital. At that hospital, she had one surgery the day after we got there and that was the one to fix the Laryngomalacia. And about three weeks later we had a huge barrage of surgeries, but she was just you know around 60 days old and she had another Supraglottoplasty, she had a G-tube put in because she wasn't going to leave the hospital without some sort of G-tube or NG-tube, and a G-tube we knew was better just because the way it functions is easier for the parents and it turns out like she still doesn't eat, so she's three years, almost three years old in December and she just doesn't eat by mouth.\", \"I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that she never did as a baby. You know, she couldn't. And so, anyways, she had that, she had a Ladd's procedure, a Nissen, an appendectomy because they were like, we were in there and it's taking up room so we could just remove it, anyways, so so they removed that anyways and, and something else I can't remember and then not her birth story, but then the following July she had another surgery and that's when they helped repair one of the holes in her heart. That's like, a lot. It's a longer story, I guess, because I don't feel like she was really ours until we got to take her home. We knew she was ours, but she was like part property of the hospital, basically for those three, you know months. So, so yeah. So she came home on March 7th and, yeah it was very exciting. Oh, it's so stressful. It was terrible.\", \"Yeah, I mean I don't like- I know in my, I know in my heart it was the best place for her to be and it's an amazing hospital and she had great nurses and you know great doctors. But that doesn't mean that it's easy. It's like 100% it's not easy. And my work was super flexible, so at least I didn't have that stress. What I did was I took six weeks off at the beginning. I came back to work for about six weeks and then we found out she was going home. So I took the rest of my six weeks then. So, I mean, where I work was super awesome and flexible with that. I think part of it has to do with the fact that I work at a medical school, so they kind of understand and they were all very you know, sympathetic, empathetic to our situation.\", \"But yeah, it was, it wasn't easy. Sometimes I would go home crying, some nights they were good nights. Most of the time she's just trying to sleep. She's just trying to get to where she could, you know, to come home. And, you know, most nights I would just go there after work, stay with her for just a couple of hours and come home. But there would be some nights where I just wouldn't even go because as I, you know, It's selfish. It sounds selfish, but she doesn't even know that I'm there. She has all these other nurses, but I would read to her, I would sing to her, I only had one terrible nurse out of everybody, just one. So, so I was lucky. We were lucky in that respect.\", 'Comment:\\tReviewed by CG 05/2020, and by AB 5/12/2020.', '']\n",

      "['I was, like, really ready to have her when I had her. It did end up being scheduled early because I was starting to be just constantly in labor. I remember, like I said, my son, his first day of kindergarten, I put one foot in the room and, and went into labor right there in his room at school, so pulled him out of the school with his grandmother and we rushed to the hospital. Once again, my husband was out of town. So I was in the hospital for a few days and then they went ahead and scheduled a C-section.', \"My husband works for an orthopedics company, so he's in, he was in surgeries all the time, so he has videoed all of my kids' births and planned to do it again with her. Her birth was much different. I, I've, She was my third C-section. There was no doubt I was going to get a C-section because I'd had two and because I, you know, she had such major problems, but this was at a different hospital because the hospital where I had the other kids did not have a neonatal intensive care and they would have had to separate us and I didn't want to be at two hospitals, so I had it in a downtown hospital in Indianapolis at Methodist Hospital.\", \"They promised me that they could actually roll my bed in and I could be with her in the NICU, which I was very excited about, because I knew she would have to go in the NICU. We knew going in she would have to have a surgery within 24 hours of birth. The good news of finding out prenatally was that we were able to prepare, so rather than get whoever was the yahoo that was on call, we found the best surgeon in the state and scheduled the surgery with him and went to the hospital where he had privileges. And even though it's rare and there were probably only 10 cases a year in Indiana at the time of duodenal atresia, he did about six cases a year, so he was the best person to see.\", \"Unfortunately, the birth experience was not great. It was a teaching hospital. I found out later that the new rounds start at the beginning of the month and she was born the 2nd, so it was actually the first day the resident that stitched me up ever had stitched somebody up, and that was quite obvious when all was said and done. The other thing was they draped me very close to my face, and I think it's when I found out I was claustrophobic, because it was so close to my face and it was giving me panic attacks, plus I couldn't see what was going on. And I think they did that on purpose in case something went wrong, that I wouldn't be seeing it, but I didn't think it was appropriate. I didn't like it and I asked them to not do it, but nobody listened to me.\", \"When she was born, they took her right away. My mother was there, she's a nurse, and she baptized her right there in the room, and my husband was with me. We don't have a video because they wouldn't let him do it for Kelly, but they took her right away and they measured XXX and all that stuff. And then they, by the time they brought her to me, I was going into shock and my body temperature dropped way, way, way, way too low, so it was a while before I got to see her again.\", \"All they showed her was this quick view of her. They had swaddled her, so I could only see this little, like, bit of her face. I couldn't see her hair, anything. It was just, like, close to her face, and she looked Hawaiian to me. She had that kind of coloration of her skin because she was very reddy. She had very, very high hematocrit because of all the fluid, her face was very swollen. And with that [redness] and, and you know, I am Italian descent and Welsh, I'm very white with very reddish hair, my mom's a redhead, she looked like a different race. I knew she was mine, but I mean, she just looked so ... It was just shocking to see somebody that doesn't even look like she could possibly belong to you.\", 'And the Down syndrome I would say was very, very evident in the turn of her eyes just because of the swelling. Once the swelling went down, she didn\\'t look that way anymore. And once that redness went away, she looked like all my other children, but that\\'s all I saw of her for, like, literally two seconds, \"Here\\'s your baby. Bye.\" And they left and took her away, and all my other children were immediately placed on my chest and I got to bond and hold them, and that is not what happened with Kelly, so that was bad.', 'Then they took me to a recovery room and they had to warm me up, because I was really not well. So I was there for a, for a good portion of the day. When they were finally going to let me out of that room, they were bringing me to a patient room and I said, \"Well no, I was told I would be able to be in the NICU.\"', 'And they said, \"Well, no, we don\\'t have a room. The NICU is really, really full right now, so you can\\'t go there.\"', 'And I said, \"Well, I\\'m not going to my room until I get to see my baby,\" so I stood up after a C-section and I got in a wheelchair and they pushed me. It was really far away, this is a huge hospital. They pushed me to the NICU and they pushed me in there, and I got, and it took a while before they let us in, and I went in to see my daughter, and I actually had to stand up because they didn\\'t have room for the wheelchair.', \"So I'm standing there, and we're talking like a few hours ago I had a C-section, I can barely feel my legs, and my husband's helping me, but I got to stand and see my baby until I couldn't stand anymore, and got back in the wheelchair. And before they brought me back to my room, I had to go and stand and dry heave in front of a trashcan for quite a while. The night was about to get really tragic, and we didn't know it, and very difficult, so they finally got me to my room. It was terrible. I was not well taken care of the whole time I was in the hospital.\", 'However, finally around 10:00 at night, my husband left with my father-in-law, so I was alone in my room and I had been told, \"Just call, someone will bring you down any time you want to see your baby.\"', 'Well, I called and called and called and called and called, and no one ever came. So finally, I got up and walked the equivalent of about three city blocks to the NICU the night after a C-section, like, it was probably 10 hours later. And I walked to her, to the NICU, and when I got there, there were about 30 people around her, her bed, and all the alarms were going off, and they just turned around and looked at me and yelled, \"You can\\'t be here! Go back to your room!\"', 'So I go out and I found somebody, so one of the nurses, and she said, \"We\\'ll call you, we\\'ll call you, we\\'ll call you.\"', \"[So at] by like 12:30 at night, no one had called me yet, I don't know if my daughter's alive or dead. So, what did I do? I got up and I walked all the way down to the NICU again at 2:00 in the morning, or 2:30, then at this point there was only the neonatologist and a physician's assistant in there, and one of them was pushing saline and the other one was pulling blood. And what they explained to me was that her hematocrit got so high that her blood basically wasn't moving, so she was so, you know, clotted up, so they were thinning out her blood and they had been for hours.\", \"So they were doing what they called a reverse transfusion. I would think to this day there's got to be a better way than for two people to be doing it by hand. I mean, they were doing it by hand, one was pushing, one was pulling on a different syringe, but it was very critical. The first person that I met in the medical community to be positive was that neonatologist. I stood there with her until 7:00 in the morning until rounds started.\", 'She filled my ear with positive stories about children with Down syndrome. She gave me glimpses into what I could expect in my life with my child, and I would really say she was really very honest and it probably really set me on a better path, because this was a terrifying experience. When I saw them all working on her, I mean, I literally thought, \"Well, I guess she\\'s not going to make it.\" You know? I just...', 'And I also didn\\'t know what I was going to have. How disabled was she going to be? What were we going to go through? If I could have glimpsed into the future. I read all those, you know, I stayed up at night one night and read all those things something can happen to a child with Down syndrome, and I remember crying all night. And so that night I just am sitting there and imagining the worst, you know, \"What if she gets leukemia? What if she gets a thyroid thing? What if her GI tract is...\" Well, I\\'m going to tell you, she\\'s had her GI tract fixed twice, she did get leukemia, she survived open heart surgery. I mean, this kid is, like, amazing, so the first five years were bad, and that was the start of it.', 'Comment:\\tReviewed by DT, 8/9/19, and again by CG 05/01/2020.', '']\n",

My mother-in-law is at the hospital with me. I think my husband may have been at work. I think he was at home. He probably worked because she was in NICU, you know, what are you going to do right? I think he went to work. My mother-in-law was at the hospital with me, she was holding her new little grand baby. She was all happy because we weren't going to give this one away right? Giving the XXX yeah So, she was all happy.

It\\'s okay.\" And she\\'s like, \"Oh, okay.\" It was kind of funny.', \"But everybody was great, I mean, nobody was ... Like I said, nobody was negative.
